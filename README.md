# **GMK 654 Web GIS LBS Project**

# 1. Group Description
This group consists of four team members in total. Majority of the team members are graduates of Geodesy and Photogrammetry Engineering. Currently, team members are continuing their master's degree in Geomatics Engineering at Hacettepe University. 
Thanks to the orientation of the team members to different disciplines, multi-disciplinary work is provided. Team members have work in both the fields of Geodesy and Photogrammetry as well as web and mobile application development.
# 2. Project Aim
The aim of the project implemented here is to combine the discipline of Geodesy and Photogrammetry with the discipline of Computer Engineering and to put forward a web-based Geographic Information Systems project. 
At the same time, in the later stages of the project, it is to expand this web-based project and produce its mobile application.
# 3. Project Goals
- Visualization and presentation of the city bicycle network of the Helsinki region within the scope of Geographic Information Systems.
- Developing web and mobile based applications by using different technologies together.
- To have the opportunity to learn and apply new technologies.
- To be able to combine different disciplines and use them together.
- To produce a usable and developable project.
# 4. Project Description
Within the scope of this project, it is aimed to visualize and present the city bicycle network of the Helsinki region within the scope of Geographic Information Systems.
In this context, dataset research was conducted. The raw dataset used can be accessed at https://www.kaggle.com/code/geometrein/helsinki-city-bike-network-analysis/notebook. Relevant data columns were extracted from the obtained raw data. For example, data that do not need to be used such as temperature in the raw data are eliminated.
Python/Django will be used as backend technology and ReactJS will be used as frontend technology. In the next stages, React Native will be used for mobile application.
SQLite will be used as a database for practicality during the development phase. In the deployment phase, MYSQL database technology will be integrated.
HEROKU (https://www.heroku.com) has been preferred as the service provider.
